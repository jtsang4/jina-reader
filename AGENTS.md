# Project Coding Rules

## Package Manager
This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager. Always use `pnpm` commands instead of `npm` or `yarn` for installing dependencies, running scripts, and managing packages.

## File Modification Policy
When implementing new requirements or features, **modify existing files directly** rather than creating new files. Only create new files when absolutely necessary (e.g., completely new modules or components). This approach helps maintain a cleaner codebase and reduces file proliferation.
